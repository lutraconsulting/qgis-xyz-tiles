    The Mappia is used in many projects (csr.ufmg.br/csr/projeto/) like: the amazon worth evaluation (csr.ufmg.br/amazones), and fire risk areas identification in real time in Brazilian cerrado (csr.ufmg.br/fipcerrado).

    We developed an simplified WMS map protocol, as part of a 4 years research, to serve the maps over any File Storage service. Just create a FREE GitHub account and start sharing your maps online today. This platform allows the customization of the map interactions and layout in an user friendly interface.
